### CPSC 120


* Lab 4
I liked this lab becuase it was the first lab where we were exposed to if and else if statements. In part 2 I was able to use these statements to guess the number that the user put in. I was also able to get more familiar with funtions and inputing math into c++.


* Lab 6
This lab was one of my favorites because the concepts were really fun. Making sandwhiches from random words and coding a blackjack project was something that was different from other labs. With these labs we learned about vectors and funcitons.


* Lab 10
I liked this lab because I found it the most challenging. We were required to take code and read from another file to gather information to put into the main program. This lab was the most complicated one out of all of them.
